#summary How to install and run the haXeVideo server
#labels Featured

= Installation =

In order to run the haXeVideo server, you need first to download install haXe from http://haxe.org/download.

You can then download the latest haXeVideo release from the *Downloads* section.

= Testing =

Once you have the source releases, run _haxe video.hxml_, this will compile a _server.n_ and a _video.swf_ file. You can start the server on localhost by executing :

    neko server.n localhost 1935

You can open the _video.html_ file to display the _videos/test.flv_ file in realtime streaming.

Although the haXeVideo FLV server works for all Flash versions, displaying the _video.swf_ requires Flash Player 9, so make sure it is installed.

= Troubleshooting =

If the player can't connect to the server, try allowing access from the SWF by using the [http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager04.html  Flash Settings Manager].
